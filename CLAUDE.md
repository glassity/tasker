# Claude Code Instructions for Tasker Project

## Project Overview
This is a Ruby-based Google Tasks client that implements Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology with interactive and console modes.

## Key Features Implemented

### Interactive Commands
- `lists` - Show all task lists
- `use <list_name>` - Set current list context
- `tasks` - Show tasks in current list
- `create <title>` - Create new task
- `complete <task_id>` - Mark task completed
- `delete <task_id>` - Delete task
- `show <task_id>` - Show full task details
- `edit <task_id>` - Edit task title, notes, due date
- `search <text>` - Search uncompleted tasks containing text
- `plan <task_id>` - Quickly schedule task (today, tomorrow, next week, etc.)
- `review <task_id>` - Review and classify task with priority/department
- `agenda` - **NEW**: Category-based time-blocking with 2-minute rule filtering
- `grooming` - **NEW**: GTD workflow for reviewing and scheduling tasks
- `recap [date]` - **NEW**: Review uncompleted tasks and create follow-up tasks for delegated items

### Console Commands
- `./bin/tasker lists`
- `./bin/tasker tasks LIST_ID`
- `./bin/tasker agenda LIST_ID` - **NEW**: Category-based time-blocking with batched calendar events
- `./bin/tasker grooming LIST_ID` - **NEW**: GTD grooming workflow
- `./bin/tasker recap LIST_ID [date]` - **NEW**: Review uncompleted tasks and create follow-up tasks

## NEW: Category-Based Agenda Time-Blocking Feature

### What it does
The `agenda` command implements a category-based GTD approach combining Google Tasks + Google Calendar:

1. **Finds today's tasks**: All uncompleted tasks with due date = today
2. **Groups by category and priority**: Organizes tasks by department (🧩Product, 📈Business, etc.) and priority within each category
3. **2-minute rule filtering**: For each task, asks if it takes less than 2 minutes; if yes, it's excluded from time-blocking
4. **Batches tasks by category**: Creates single calendar events for all tasks in each category
5. **30-minute average per task**: Calculates total time block duration (e.g., 3 tasks = 90 minutes)
6. **User-confirmed scheduling**: User specifies the start time for each category block
7. **Efficient context switching**: Groups related tasks together to minimize cognitive overhead

### Usage Examples

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# After selecting a list with 'use <list_name>'
agenda
```

**Console Mode:**
```bash
./bin/tasker agenda LIST_ID
```

### Expected Output Flow

  - Total estimated time
  - "Created by GTD Task Manager" footer
- **Color**: Green (color_id = 10) for easy identification

## NEW: Grooming Workflow Feature

### What it does
The `grooming` command implements a complete Getting Things Done workflow that:

1. **Finds tasks needing attention**: All uncompleted tasks that are either:
   - Past due date, OR
   - Have no due date

2. **Review Phase** (for unclassified tasks):
   - Identifies tasks with empty notes or no priority/department emojis
   - Forces user to review each unclassified task
   - Applies priority (🔥Hot, 🟢Must, 🟠Nice, 🔴NotNow) 
   - Applies department (🧩Product, 📈Business, 📢Marketing, 🔒Security, 👩‍💼Others)

3. **Planning Phase** (for all tasks):
   - Goes through all grooming tasks in creation date order
   - Shows current classification and due date status
   - Provides quick scheduling options:
     - Today, Tomorrow
     - Next Monday through Friday
     - Remove current date
     - Skip this task

### Usage Examples

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# After selecting a list with 'use <list_name>'
grooming
```

**Console Mode:**
```bash
./bin/tasker grooming LIST_ID
```

### Expected Output Flow

## NEW: Recap Feature for Delegation Follow-ups

### What it does
The `recap` command implements a delegation follow-up workflow for uncompleted tasks:

1. **Finds uncompleted tasks**: All tasks with due dates on or before a specific date (today, yesterday, or custom date)
2. **Reviews each task**: Asks if any task is waiting for something from someone else
3. **Creates follow-up tasks**: For delegated items, creates new tasks with:
   - What you're expecting to receive
   - From whom you're expecting it
   - Link back to the original task
   - Automatically scheduled (tomorrow for today's recap, next Monday for past dates)

### Usage Examples

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# After selecting a list with 'use <list_name>'
recap                    # Review today's uncompleted tasks
recap yesterday         # Review yesterday's uncompleted tasks
recap 2025-01-15       # Review specific date's uncompleted tasks
```

**Console Mode:**
```bash
./bin/tasker recap LIST_ID              # Today's uncompleted tasks
./bin/tasker recap LIST_ID yesterday    # Yesterday's uncompleted tasks
./bin/tasker recap LIST_ID 2025-01-15  # Specific date's uncompleted tasks
```

### Expected Output Flow

💡 Tips for managing follow-ups:
• Use 'search follow' to find all follow-up tasks
• Mark original tasks as complete once follow-ups are resolved
• Review follow-ups regularly to stay on top of delegated work
```

### Follow-up Task Structure
Each follow-up task includes comprehensive notes with:
- What you're expecting
- From whom
- Original task due date
- Recap date
- Link to original task (ID and title)
- Full context from original task notes

## Authentication Requirements

The hybrid agenda feature requires both Google Tasks and Google Calendar API access:

1. **Google Tasks API**: Already configured with existing OAuth setup
2. **Google Calendar API**: Uses the same OAuth credentials and token file
3. **Scopes**: The application now requests both Tasks and Calendar permissions
4. **First-time setup**: User may need to re-authenticate to grant Calendar access

## Testing Guidelines

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Never create automated tests that run against real Google Tasks data. This would modify the user's actual tasks and compromise privacy.

**For testing grooming:**
1. User should manually run: `ruby bin/tasker interactive` or `ruby bin/tasker grooming LIST_ID`  
2. User can test with their own disposable task lists
3. Verify the workflow phases work correctly:
   - Task identification (overdue + no due date)
   - Review phase for unclassified tasks
   - Planning phase for all tasks
   - Proper context switching and data preservation

## Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=1` environment variable to see detailed API calls and internal state.

## Architecture Notes
- `lib/google_tasks_client.rb` - Google Tasks API wrapper
- `lib/interactive_mode.rb` - Interactive shell and workflows
- `bin/tasker` - Console interface
- All grooming logic preserves task titles and notes while updating classifications and due dates
- Uses RFC3339 format for Google Tasks API dates
- Auto-schedules tasks at 9:00 AM for consistency
